This repo is a collection of coding challenges I've worked on to keep my coding skills sharp.

## Why Swift?

I started my career as an iOS developer and because I'm constantly working in different languages, Swift has always been my preferred language for coding exercises/interviews. Swift is so second nature to me that I can focus on the problem even if I haven't written Swift in a professional setting for 6 years. Strong type system, stable standard library, etc.

## Where do you get them?

I use Claude to share coding challenges. My prompt is:

> I would like to continue my technical interview practice. Can you provide me with a code challenge that can be completed in 25-30 minutes? This should follow the format of a coding interview where I may ask follow-up questions but I want you to provide clarifications to my question, not the answer or solutions. They should also be puzzles that are completed in stages, with increasing complexity. Can you provide me with a coding challenge?

And I set a timer for 30 minutes.
